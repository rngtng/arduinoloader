= arduinoloader

This processing library uploads sketches to your Arduino by using java. No dependencies on avrdude etc. This comes very handy if you want to include
sketchupload into your processing app (e.g. updating the firmware).  So users don√Ñt have to uses the Arduino IDE anymore - nice!

The was originally written by Dave Brink (davebrink at prodigy.net) see his releases here:
http://mail.arduino.cc/pipermail/developers_arduino.cc/2009-February/000544.html

with that the Arduino bootleader could even be optimised, he includes the sources here:
http://mail.arduino.cc/pipermail/developers_arduino.cc/2009-February/000546.html

right now it works successfully for ATmega168 but not ATmega328. I'll investigate further on that..

== Usage
see exmaples/Loader.pde basically it's just one line, given .hex fiel (compiled Arduino sketch), portName, baudRate and pageSize

  ArduinoLoader.upload( hexFile, portName, baudRate, pageSize);
  
  
Have Fun!
